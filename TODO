IMPROVEMENTS (arguably features):

- Optimize encode/decoding
    Currently it's very dumb with large blobs but on the plus side it's reliable and simple.
    Options include implementing:
      (1) a custom encoder
          + in house
          + ultra slim blobs !!
          - backwards compatibility considerations
          - more complex
      (2) ...or...using a string compression library like gzip or lz.

- Key shortcuts for all menu options (numbered)

- diamond resize bit odd with other layers.

- joiner layer with arrow heads won't always show - zindex.

- captures on every change instead of mouseup

- clever resize: text in boxes main issue
